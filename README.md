# MouseoverButtonEffectsJS
This JavaScript project creates mouseover effects for buttons.


The objective of this project was to create code that changes images when a user mouses over them.Â 

When the mouse is over the image, the source of the image should change, and when the mouse moves back out of the image it should revert to its original source.
